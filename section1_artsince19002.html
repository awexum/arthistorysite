    <h1>Section 1: Psychoanalysis in Modernism and as Method</h1>
    <p>
        This section delves into the influence of psychoanalysis on modernist art movements, particularly in the early 20th century. Artists of this period sought to explore the depths of the human psyche and understand the subconscious mind. Inspired by Sigmund Freud's groundbreaking theories, they incorporated psychological concepts such as dreams, the unconscious mind, and the interpretation of symbols into their works.

        Artists like Salvador Dalí, Max Ernst, and René Magritte were at the forefront of the Surrealist movement, which sought to liberate the creative process from rational constraints. They used visual imagery to express inner desires, delve into the irrational, and challenge established artistic conventions. Surrealists embraced automatic writing and spontaneous drawing techniques to tap into the unconscious and explore the mysteries of the mind.

        <strong>René Magritte:</strong> Magritte's paintings challenged the viewer's perception and the relationship between words and images. His iconic work "The Treachery of Images" features a pipe with the text "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" (This is not a pipe), highlighting the distinction between representation and reality.
